# Testing Sample

For this testing sample I chose an API, because I have more experience with website testing and wanted to try this route. I used a couple of hours for this ample and divided it between manual and automation testing 
The chosen API: https://restful-booker.herokuapp.com/apidoc/index.html#api-Booking-CreateBooking 

Manual Testing 
I created a few manual tests in simple charts. In real life scenario, the tests would be created ant maintained with some test maintenance tool (Jira etc..). 
The tests should show how I would start defining manual test cases. 

Automation Testing 
I created a very simple robot framework script that gets the information from the API, posts information and deletes it. The script hopefully gives some indication on how I would start developing the automation scripts.
The tests themselves are very simple and in a real scenario would require much more depth.
